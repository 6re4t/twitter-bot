# twitter-bot
A Twitter bot using Llama 2 7b.

This requires a Twitter developer account with API access, preferably the paid version. The free version is almost useless and barely allows any pulls (Thanks Elon). Also required is a Hugging Face account with Llama 2 access permissions. The LLM is swappable with any other similar one as well but this works well.
